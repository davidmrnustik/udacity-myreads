# MyReads Project

This is final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) has been used to bootstrap the project.

## Install / Run

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## App

The main page shows 3 shelves for books: currently reading, want to read, and read. User can change shelf of every book. A book has a modal view with detailed information. Modal window also allows user to categorize a book. There is Search page where user can search and select shelf of desired book.

## Project improvements beyond a basic version

* Loading / Updating window when a process is in progress (fetching data, changing bookshelves)
* Number of books in bookshelves
* A notice when there is no book in some bookshelf
* Modal window with detailed information including star-rating view (when possible) and bookshelf control
